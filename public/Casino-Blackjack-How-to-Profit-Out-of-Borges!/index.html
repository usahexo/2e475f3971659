Look no further than the legendary Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges.</p>
<p>Although Borges never actually played blackjack himself, he left behind some insightful tips on how to beat the game. Below are three of his key strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Play with a low bet and only increase if you are winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of which cards have been played and use this information to your advantage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be unpredictable in your playing style - mix up your betting patterns and always keep the casino guessing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these tips, you can give yourself the best chance of winning at casino blackjack - and making some profit out of Borges in the process!</p>
<h1 id="Borges-The-Casino-Blackjack-Killer"><a href="#Borges-The-Casino-Blackjack-Killer" class="headerlink" title="Borges: The Casino Blackjack Killer!"></a>Borges: The Casino Blackjack Killer!</h1><p>Most people know of Jorge Luis Borges as one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century. But what they may not know is that he was also a blackjack killer!</p>
<p>Borges was an avid gambler, and blackjack was his game of choice. He would often frequent casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, where he would routinely take down the house.</p>
<p>One of Borges’ tricks was to count cards. He would keep track of which cards had been played, and then adjust his bet accordingly. This allowed him to gain a statistical advantage over the casino, and resulted in many big wins.</p>
<p>Borges once boasted that he had won $2 million from blackjack over the course of his career. Not bad for someone who described himself as a “loser at life”!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Profit-out-of-Casino-Blackjack-like-Borges"><a href="#How-to-Profit-out-of-Casino-Blackjack-like-Borges" class="headerlink" title="How to Profit out of Casino Blackjack like Borges"></a>How to Profit out of Casino Blackjack like Borges</h1><p>A few weeks ago, I was sidelined by a particularly nasty cold. This forced me to stay in my apartment and catch up on some long overdue reading. One of the books I read was “The Book of Imaginary Beings” by Jorge Luís Borges. The book is a compilation of short essays on imaginary creatures, some of which are based on ancient myths and others that Borges made up himself.</p>
<p>While reading the book, I couldn’t help but think about how some of the imaginary creatures could be applied to blackjack. In this article, I will share three strategies that blackjack players can use to profit like Borges.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Obfuscation to Confuse the Dealer</li>
</ol>
<p>Borges was a master of obfuscation, and blackjack players can use this to their advantage. Obfuscation is simply the act of making something difficult to understand or see. When playing blackjack, you can use obfuscation to confuse the dealer and give yourself an edge.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do this. For example, you can take odd bets that the dealer may not expect, such as betting on two different suits when the first two cards are the same suit. You can also vary your betting patterns from session to session or table to table. By doing this, you make it difficult for the dealer to predict what you are going to do next, which will ultimately lead to more mistakes on their part.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use Ambiguity Against the House Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>Another strategy that Borges used in his writing was ambiguity. Ambiguity is defined as unclear or uncertain meaning. When playing blackjack, you can use ambiguity against the house rules to your advantage.</p>
<p>For example, many casinos have a rule that states that blackjack pays even money if the player has a blackjack and the dealer has an ace showing. However, there is also a rule that says players lose their wagers if they push (tie). So what happens if you have a blackjack and the dealer has an ace showing? Well, according to house rules, you would lose your wager even though you technically won the hand!</p>
<p>By understanding and using ambiguous language like this against casino rules, you can give yourself an edge over the house. Be sure to check with casino staff before playing so that you know what the specific house rules are.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Imagination Against Probability Theory</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, Borges was also known for his imaginative prose style which often defied probability theory. Blackjack players can use this same approach against casino odds by using their imagination to create advantageous situations.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that you are playing at a six-deck game where the dealer stands on all 17s. You have a total of 18 and decide to hit (draw another card). The dealer flips over her second card – it’s another 10! This gives her a total of 27 – one higher than your 18! If you had decided not to hit and just stand with your original 18 total, there is a good chance that the dealer would have busted (gone over 21). However, because you hit and got unlucky, you now lose the hand instead!</p>
<p>This may seem like an unfair scenario, but it’s simply how probability theory works in blackjack (and in life). However, by using your imagination ,you can sometimes create better outcomes for yourself than what probability theory would suggest. In essence, this is what gambling is all about – using your imagination against casino odds!</p>

<pre><code>First let&#39;s take a look at some of the basic blackjack terminology that you&#39;ll need to know before playing: Dealer - The person who deals the cards in casino blackjack. Player - You! The person who is playing against the dealer. Banker - In baccarat, this is one of the two roles that players can choose from. In casino blackjack, there is no banker role so this term isn&#39;t used in that context. Bust - When your total card value exceeds 21, thereby losing the hand automatically House Edge - The percentage advantage that the casino has over players in any given game Card Values - All face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points each, Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points (your choice), and all other numbers from 2-10 are worth their face value Suit - The four categories into which all playing cards are divided: spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs Hit - Taking another card from the deck Stand - Refusing any more cards and sticking with what you have Double Down - Doubling your bet and receiving just one more card Split Pairs - Splitting your starting hand into two separate hands (usually when you&#39;re dealt two of the same card value) Insurance Bet - An optional side bet that can be made when playing casino blackjack Surrendering Your Hand - Giving up half of your original bet amount after seeing your first two cards If at any time you want to take a break from reading about blackjack strategy and try out some games for free head on over to our free games page where we have all sorts of fun titles waiting for you!
