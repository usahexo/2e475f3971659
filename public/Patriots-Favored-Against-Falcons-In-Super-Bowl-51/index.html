        <h1 id="Patriots-Favored-Against-Falcons-In-Super-Bowl-51"><a href="#Patriots-Favored-Against-Falcons-In-Super-Bowl-51" class="headerlink" title="Patriots Favored Against Falcons In Super Bowl 51"></a>Patriots Favored Against Falcons In Super Bowl 51</h1><p>The New England Patriots are favored to win the Super Bowl this year, as they take on the Atlanta Falcons. The Patriots come into the game as heavy favorites, after cruising through the playoffs with a record of 14-2. The Falcons, on the other hand, had to overcome some adversity in order to make it to the Super Bowl. They started the season 5-0, but then lost four of their next six games. However, they were able to recover and win their final two games of the season to clinch the NFC South division title.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why the Patriots are favored is because of their quarterback,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> Tom Brady. Brady is considered to be one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history, and he has been playing extremely well lately. In fact, he has not been intercepted in his last nine games. Additionally, the Patriots have one of the best defenses in football, which could give Atlanta trouble.</p>
<p>The Falcons do have some talented players on their team, including quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones. However, it is unlikely that they will be able to match up with New England’s potent offense. It is also worth noting that Atlanta’s defense has been susceptible to giving up big plays throughout the season.</p>
<p>All things considered, it looks like New England is going to be too much for Atlanta to handle in Super Bowl 51. The Patriots are expected to win by a score of 27-17.</p>
<h1 id="Seahawks-Packers-Among-Favorites-To-Win-NFC"><a href="#Seahawks-Packers-Among-Favorites-To-Win-NFC" class="headerlink" title="Seahawks, Packers Among Favorites To Win NFC"></a>Seahawks, Packers Among Favorites To Win NFC</h1><p>The NFL offseason is in full swing and that means it is time to start looking ahead to the upcoming season. The NFC looks to be very competitive with a number of teams vying for one of the six playoff spots. The Seattle Seahawks and Green Bay Packers are among the favorites to win the NFC.</p>
<p>The Seahawks had a disappointing end to their season, losing in the Wild Card round to the Carolina Panthers. However, they still have one of the best quarterbacks in the league in Russell Wilson and a defense that is capable of shutting down any offense. The Packers finished the season strong, making it all the way to the NFC Championship game before losing to the Atlanta Falcons. They have one of the best quarterbacks in Aaron Rodgers and a tough defense that can shut down opposing offenses.</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys, Minnesota Vikings, and Washington Redskins are also contenders in the NFC. The Cowboys had a very successful season last year, finishing with the best record in the NFC. However, they lost in heartbreaking fashion to the Packers in the Divisional round of the playoffs. The Vikings were just one game away from making it to the Super Bowl last year, losing to the Philadelphia Eagles in heartbreaking fashion. The Redskins had a disappointing season last year but still have plenty of talent on their roster.</p>
<p>There are also a few teams that could surprise people and make a run at the playoffs. The Philadelphia Eagles surprised many people last year by winning their first Super Bowl title. They have kept most of their team intact and should be even better this year. The New Orleans Saints finished with the 3rd best record in the NFC last year and have one of the best quarterbacks in Drew Brees. If they can improve their defense, they could be a serious threat this year.</p>
<p>The NFL is always full of surprises so it is hard to predict who will come out on top in the NFC this year. However, there is no doubt that it will be an exciting race to see who comes out on top</p>
<h1 id="Vikings-Tabbed-As-offseason-Sleeper-Team"><a href="#Vikings-Tabbed-As-offseason-Sleeper-Team" class="headerlink" title="Vikings Tabbed As offseason Sleeper Team"></a>Vikings Tabbed As offseason Sleeper Team</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings have long been one of the most successful NFL franchises. However, in recent years they have fallen short of expectations, failing to make the playoffs in each of the last two seasons. This has led to some offseason changes, including the hiring of new head coach Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Norv Turner.</p>
<p>Many experts are writing off the Vikings this year, expecting them to finish near the bottom of the NFC North division. However, I believe that this could be the year that they breakout and return to playoff contention.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Vikings have a lot of talent on their roster. They feature one of the best defensive players in the league in linebacker Chad Greenway, as well as several other Pro Bowl caliber players such as running back Adrian Peterson and cornerback Xavier Rhodes.</p>
<p>In addition, Mike Zimmer is an extremely talented head coach who is known for his defensive prowess. Under his guidance, I believe that the Vikings’ defense will only get better this year.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that Norv Turner is an excellent offensive coordinator who will be able to get more out of quarterback Matt Cassel than former coordinator Bill Musgrave was able to. With Turner’s help, I expect Minnesota’s offense to be much improved this year.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe that the Vikings are a sleeper team heading into the 2014 season. They have a lot of talent on their roster, and with a new coaching staff in place I think they are poised for a breakout year.</p>
<h1 id="Romo-Retires-Cowboys-Turn-To-Dak-Prescott"><a href="#Romo-Retires-Cowboys-Turn-To-Dak-Prescott" class="headerlink" title="Romo Retires: Cowboys Turn To Dak Prescott"></a>Romo Retires: Cowboys Turn To Dak Prescott</h1><p>The Dallas Cowboys have announced that Tony Romo is stepping down and will be replaced by Dak Prescott. This comes as a surprise to many, as Romo has been the starter for the Cowboys since 2006.</p>
<p>Romo has had an impressive career, but has been plagued with injuries in recent years. Prescott, who is just 23 years old, played well in relief of Romo this past season and appears to be the team’s quarterback of the future.</p>
<p>The move signals a new era for the Cowboys, who are looking to build around Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott, their rookie running back. The team is also hoping to rebuild its defense this offseason.</p>
<p>This should be an interesting offseason for the Cowboys, who are looking to return to contention after missing the playoffs last season.</p>
<h1 id="Patriots-Heading-Into-2017-Season-As-Defending-Champions"><a href="#Patriots-Heading-Into-2017-Season-As-Defending-Champions" class="headerlink" title="Patriots Heading Into 2017 Season As Defending Champions"></a>Patriots Heading Into 2017 Season As Defending Champions</h1><p>The New England Patriots will be heading into the 2017 season as defending champions. This will be the team’s third Super Bowl in four years and they are looking to make it back-to-back championships.</p>
<p>Even though they have lost key players such as LeGarrette Blount, Martellus Bennett and Logan Ryan, the Patriots still have a very talented roster. Tom Brady is still one of the best quarterbacks in the league and Bill Belichick is one of the best coaches.</p>
<p>The Patriots will have their work cut out for them this season, as they will be facing some tough competition in the AFC. The Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos all look like they could be contenders this year.</p>
<p>However, if anyone can win back-to-back championships, it’s the Patriots. They have proved that they are one of the best teams in the NFL and they are not going to give up their title without a fight.</p>
