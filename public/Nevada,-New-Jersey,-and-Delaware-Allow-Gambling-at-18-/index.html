        <h1 id="Nevada-New-Jersey-and-Delaware-Allow-Gambling-at-18"><a href="#Nevada-New-Jersey-and-Delaware-Allow-Gambling-at-18" class="headerlink" title="Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware Allow Gambling at 18"></a>Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware Allow Gambling at 18</h1><p>According to the American Gaming Association, Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware are the only states in the United States where gambling is allowed at 18 years old. In these states, young adults can legally gamble in casinos, racetracks, and poker rooms. </p>
<p>The age limit for gambling is 21 in most other states. However, there are some exceptions. In South Dakota, for example, the legal age for gambling is 18 at casinos on Indian reservations and 19 at other casinos. </p>
<p>In most cases, the minimum legal age for gambling is determined by state law. The rules vary from state to state. But in general, the age limit for gambling is higher than the minimum legal drinking age in most states. </p>
<p>The decision to allow young adults to gamble at 18 is often based on the assumption that they are old enough to make responsible decisions about their money. And studies show that most young adults do not start gambling until they are older. </p>
<p>Casino owners also argue that allowing young adults to gamble can help reduce illegal gambling activity by minors. Gambling among minors is a problem in many states. In fact, a study by Harvard University found that nearly half of all high school students have gambled in some form or another. </p>
<p>Critics of legalizing gambling at 18 argue that it can lead to addiction and other problems for young adults. But supporters argue that restricting gambling to 21 years or older does not solve the problem and simply drives it underground. </p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to each individual state to decide what age limit is best for gambling. But as more and more states consider legalizing online poker and other forms of gambling, we may see more changes in the age limit laws.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-and-Pennsylvania-Allow-Gambling-at-21"><a href="#Rhode-Island-and-Pennsylvania-Allow-Gambling-at-21" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island and Pennsylvania Allow Gambling at 21"></a>Rhode Island and Pennsylvania Allow Gambling at 21</h1><p>In two states in the US, gambling is now legal for those aged 21 and over. Rhode Island and Pennsylvania are the most recent states to relax their gambling laws, both of which join Missouri as states where those aged 21 or older can gamble in some form.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s new law allows people 21 and over to gamble in casinos, racetracks, and online. The law contains a list of restrictions however; those under 21 are not allowed to enter casinos, play any table games or slot machines, or collect any winnings. Alcohol is also not allowed in the presence of minors.</p>
<p>Rhode Island’s new law is more limited in scope; it only allows those aged 21 and over to gamble at the state’s two casinos. The law does not mention alcohol or other age restrictions.</p>
<p>So far, there have been no noticeable changes in either state as a result of the new laws; business as usual seems to be continuing at the casinos and racetracks. Some observers believe that this could be the start of a trend, with other states relaxing their gambling laws in order to bring in tax revenue.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-is-the-Only-State-that-Allows-Gambling-at-Age-18"><a href="#West-Virginia-is-the-Only-State-that-Allows-Gambling-at-Age-18" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia is the Only State that Allows Gambling at Age 18"></a>West Virginia is the Only State that Allows Gambling at Age 18</h1><p>In the United States, gambling is only legal for adults aged 21 and up. This means that those who are below this age cannot legally partake in any form of gambling in any of the 50 states. However, there is one exception to this rule – West Virginia.</p>
<p>West Virginia is the only state in the US that allows people aged 18 and up to gamble. This means that people as young as 18 can go to a casino, horse track, or lottery outlet and place bets. While this may seem like a perk for young people, it has actually caused some problems in the state.</p>
<p>One issue with West Virginia’s gambling laws is that many 18-year-olds do not have the financial resources to gamble responsibly. They may end up spending more money than they can afford on games of chance, which can lead to financial hardship. Additionally, many young people are not yet experienced enough to make informed betting decisions, which can also lead to financial problems.</p>
<p>Another issue with West Virginia’s gambling laws is that they allow minors to gamble without any parental supervision. This can be risky, as young people may end up gambling away money that they need for food or rent. It can also lead to them developing a gambling addiction at an early age.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, West Virginia’s laws remain unchanged. The state government has no plans to raise the minimum gambling age any time soon. So if you’re 18 or older, you’re free to gamble in West Virginia!</p>
<h1 id="MGM-National-Harbor-to-Launch-in-Maryland-on-December-8th"><a href="#MGM-National-Harbor-to-Launch-in-Maryland-on-December-8th" class="headerlink" title="MGM National Harbor to Launch in Maryland on December 8th"></a>MGM National Harbor to Launch in Maryland on December 8th</h1><p> MGM National Harbor, a new casino and resort destination opening in Maryland on December 8th, is expected to bring some much-needed excitement to the region. The $1.4 billion project, located just south of Washington D.C., is set on 23 acres of waterfront property and will include a luxury hotel, high-end shops and restaurants, and a world-class casino with over 125,000 square feet of gaming floor space.</p>
<p>The resort is also touting a number of top-notch entertainment venues, including a 3,000-seat theater for concerts and headlining performances, as well as a 20,000 square foot spa. Excitement for the new casino has been palpable in the months leading up to its launch; in September it was announced that the first ever performance at MGM National Harbor would be by Mariah Carey.</p>
<p>With its close proximity to our nation’s capital and its wide range of amenities and attractions, MGM National Harbor is expected to draw tourists from all over - in fact, the casino has already begun hiring more than 4,000 employees. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has even proclaimed December 8th “MGM National Harbor Day” in honor of the opening.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exciting (and potentially lucrative) weekend getaway this December, be sure to check out MGM National Harbor!</p>

The casino will now be able to add 750 slot machines to its property.</p>
<p>According to PGCB spokeswoman Nils Hagen-Frederiksen, the vote was 5-0 in favor of the new slot parlor. Frederiksen also said that the approval is “subject to final licensing by the board.”</p>
<p>The new slot parlor will be located next to the casino’s main property and will include a bar and lounge. It is expected to create about 100 jobs.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mount Airy Casino Resort CEO Bruce Deifik said that he was “thrilled” with the PGCB’s decision. “This approval allows us to move forward with an exciting project that will bring more entertainment and gaming options to our guests,” he said.</p>
<p>Mount Airy Casino Resort is one of six casinos in Pennsylvania. It currently has 2,000 slot machines and 200 table games.</p>
