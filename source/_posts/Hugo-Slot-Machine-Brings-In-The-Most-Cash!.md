#  Get Your Piece of the Hugo Slot Machine Cash!

The Hugo Awards are one of the most prestigious honors a science fiction or fantasy author can receive. They’re awarded annually by the World Science Fiction Society, and every year there’s a mad scramble for nominations from fans and publishers alike.

This year is no different, with the deadline for submissions coming up on March 31st. So if you want your book to be in with a chance of being nominated, you need to get moving!

But what if you don’t have a book published yet? Or worse, what if your last book came out years ago and you’re not sure it would qualify for this year’s awards?

Don’t worry – there are still ways to get your piece of the Hugo pie!

One option is to submit a fanzine or other work of amateur fiction. This is a great way to get your work seen by the judges, and as an added bonus, it doesn’t matter if your work has been published before or not.

If you’d prefer to submit a professionally published book, there are still ways to make it eligible. The easiest way is to self-publish your work in ebook form, as long as it meets certain criteria (more on that below).

Or if you want to nominate an older book that isn’t available in ebook form, you can submit an authorized edition in any format. This could be anything from scanning the original print copy and submitting it as a PDF, to creating an audiobook version yourself.

So don’t let lack of recent publication stop you from entering this year’s Hugo Awards! There are plenty of ways to get involved, no matter what stage of your writing career you’re at.
