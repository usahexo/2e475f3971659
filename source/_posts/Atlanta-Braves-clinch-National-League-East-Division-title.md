#  Atlanta Braves clinch National League East Division title

The Atlanta Braves clinched the National League East Division title on September 22, clinching their first divisional title since 2013. The Braves were led by young stars such as Ronald Acuna Jr. and Ozzie Albies, who helped the team to an impressive record of 91-71.

The Braves will now look to make a deep playoff run, with their sights set on winning the World Series. They will face the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series, with the first game scheduled for October 4.

#  Atlanta Braves win National League pennant

The Atlanta Braves have won the National League pennant, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in four games in the league championship series. The Braves are now one step away from their first World Series win since 1995.

The Braves went into the series as underdogs, but they proved that they were a force to be reckoned with, winning two of the three games at Dodger Stadium. The only game that the Dodgers won was game three, which was played in Atlanta. In game four, the Dodgers were leading 3-0 going into the bottom of the ninth inning. However, Atlanta mounted a remarkable comeback, scoring four runs in the inning to win the game 4-3 and take the series.

The Braves will now face either the Boston Red Sox or Houston Astros in the World Series. Boston currently lead that series 2-1.

#  Atlanta Braves win World Series championship

For the first time in their history, the Atlanta Braves are World Series champions. They won Game 7 against the Cleveland Indians by a score of 3-2.

It was a back and forth game, with both teams scoring two runs apiece. The Braves got on the board first in the second inning, when Greg Maddux hit a sacrifice fly to score Marquis Grissom. The Indians tied it up in the fifth inning when Jim Thome hit a home run off of John Smoltz.

In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Braves took the lead when David Justice hit a solo home run off of Alan Embree. The Indians threatened to tie it up or take the lead in the top of the ninth inning, but Maddux closed out the game for his third win of this World Series.

The Braves are now world champions for only the second time in their history (the first time being in 1995). This championship was especially sweet for manager Bobby Cox, who was retiring from managing after this season.
