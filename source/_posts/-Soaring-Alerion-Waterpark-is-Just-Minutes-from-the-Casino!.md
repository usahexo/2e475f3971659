Start your morning off by taking a stroll up the beautiful Alerion Express. The views along this aerial tram are some of the best in the valley. Once you reach the top, spend some time exploring the area or enjoy a bite to eat at one of the restaurants on site.

#  Soaring Alerion and the Casino- Perfect for a Fun Day Out!

As a convert to the wonderful world of soaring, I have to say that the Alerion Sailplanes casino near perfect for a fun day out! I was skeptical at first, but having now flown there a few times, it is definitely one of my favorite spots.

The atmosphere at the casino is very relaxed and welcoming. You can either spend your time chatting with other pilots in the pilots lounge or take a stroll around the hangar and admire the planes. There's also a great view of the airport from up here.

The flying area is large and forgiving, with plenty of lift even on a hot day. The staff are always happy to help you get airborne, and landing back at the casino is a breeze- even for novice pilots like me.

All in all, an enjoyable day out for anyone interested in aviation or simply looking for a good time. I'll definitely be returning soon!
