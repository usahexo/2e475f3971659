#  Relax Gaming Launches First Real Money Online Slot Game in Sweden

On Thursday, Relax Gaming Ltd. announced the launch of its first real money online slot game in Sweden.

#  Pennsylvania Gambling Regulators Approve Online Casino Relax Gaming License

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has given the green light to Relax Gaming Limited for a casino operator license. The company already has a license for online gaming, but this is the first time that it will be able to offer slots and table games to players in the state.

This is a major win for Relax Gaming, as Pennsylvania is one of the biggest gaming markets in the world. The PGCB oversees 12 land-based casinos, along with 6 racetracks that offer slot machines. In addition, there are also more than 1,200 licensed online gaming operators in the state.

Commenting on the approval, Relax Gaming CEO James Watson said: “We are excited to be granted a full casino licence by the PGCB. This important endorsement represents another key milestone in our expansion strategy and will allow us to provide our partners with an even wider range of products and services as we continue to build our business in the US market.”

The company already has a strong presence in the United States, with partnerships with prominent companies such as MGM Resorts International and Boyd Gaming Corporation. These deals give Relax Gaming access to some of the most popular land-based casinos in America.

The new license will allow Relax Gaming to offer its games through its own portals, as well as through other licensed operators in Pennsylvania. This will provide players with a much wider selection of games, including slots, table games, and poker.

#  Malta Gives Green Light to Online Casino Relax Gaming

In a recent development, the Maltese government has granted a license to Relax Gaming to operate an online casino from the island nation. This is considered a major development in the industry, as Relax Gaming is a relatively new company that only launched its services earlier this year.

The company is headquartered in Sweden and already operates several other gaming brands, including a bingo site and a number of white-label casinos. It is not yet clear which of these brands will be brought to Malta or whether any new products will be added to the portfolio.

According to a statement released by Relax Gaming, the company intends to use Malta as a base for its European operations. It also plans to expand its team of experts in order to provide "the very best in iGaming content and experience".

Malta has been seen as one of the most favourable jurisdictions in Europe for online casinos, thanks to its well-developed regulatory framework and friendly business environment. The decision by Relax Gaming is another indication that the country is continuing to attract top players in the industry.

Over the past few years, Malta has become known as 'The Silicon Valley of Europe' due to the large number of tech startups that have chosen to set up their headquarters there. In addition, many established companies - including international gaming operators - have also established operations on the island.
