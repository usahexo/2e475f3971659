#  Stars and Jokers is the most exciting card game to hit the market in years!

### What is Stars and Jokers?

Stars and Jokers is a brand new, exciting card game that is taking the world by storm. It is easy to learn, but challenging to master, and provides hours of entertainment for players of all ages.

### How do you play?

The basic rules of Stars and Jokers are very simple. There are three ways to score points in the game - by scoring stars, jokers, or sets. You can win the game by either scoring the most points, or by completing one of several special objectives revealed at the beginning of the game.

To start, each player is dealt five cards. The remainder of the deck is placed face down in the middle of the players. The face up card at the bottom of the deck is turned over to begin the turn. On a player's turn they draw one card from either the deck or another player's hand, then play one. The Ace is high and each number card has a corresponding value (2-10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points and an Ace can be used as either 1 or 11 points. When playing a card, the adjacent number cards also become part of its suit. For example, if an 8 is played, then both 7s and 6s become part of that suit). The 4 suits are Hearts (red), Clubs (black), Spades (black), Diamonds (green).

The first player begins by playing any card they choose. The next player then must play a card that is either equal to or higher than the first card played. If they cannot play a legal card, they must pick up one card from either the deck or another player's hand. When playing a Joker, it can be used as any other card in the deck (e.g., if an Ace is played, then a Joker could be used as an 11). If both players have no more cards in their hand, then they must pick up two cards from either the deck or other player's hand on their turn instead of just one. The winner of the round scores any points shown on the cards that were played. After all rounds have been completed, final scoring takes place. Points are totaled for each type of card - stars are worth 5 points each, jokers are worth 25 points each, sets are worth 3 points each - then any bonuses are awarded for completing objectives during gameplay (e.g., for example winning without picking up any cards would score an extra 10 points). The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!

### What are some tips for mastering Stars and Jokers?

There are a few key things to keep in mind if you want to become a master at Stars and Jokers:
1) Pay attention to what types of cards your opponents are playing - this will give you clues about what kinds of sets they might be trying to put together!
2) Keep track of how many cards remain in both your hand and in the deck - this will help you plan your next move accordingly!
3) Use your jokers wisely - they can be very powerful weapons if used correctly!

California is one of the states that imposes a gambling tax on its residents. The tax is calculated as a percentage of the “net winnings” from gambling activities. This includes not just winnings from casino games, but also lottery prizes, betting winnings, and other forms of gambling income.

The amount of gambling tax you owe in California will depend on your taxable income. The state’s progressive income tax system means that higher-income taxpayers will pay a higher percentage of their winnings in tax. As of 2019, the highest rate for gambling tax in California is 13%.

However, even if your taxable income falls below this threshold, you still need to report your gambling income and pay tax on it. The exact amount you owe will depend on your total income and other deductions.

If you’re unsure how much gambling tax you owe in California, it’s best to speak to an accountant or financial advisor. They can help you calculate your exact liability and make sure you don’t overpay.

#  stars and jokers, card game, how much tax

Cards games are popular all over the world. People of different ages, professions and cultures enjoy playing cards games. 

The game of stars and jokers is one such game that is loved by many. It is a simple game to play and does not require any special skills or equipment to participate. The objective of the game is to collect as many points as possible by taking tricks. 

There are 52 cards in a deck and each player is dealt 13 cards. The remainder of the deck is placed in the middle of the players, face down. The first player picks up 3 cards from the deck and sets them face up on the table. The player to their left then picks up 2 cards and sets them beside the first 3. This process continues until all players have picked up 7 cards, which will form their initial hand. The player who picks up the last card must set it face down in front of them as their turn will not end yet. 

The active player can either play a card from their hand or pick up a card from the table. When playing a card, the rank of the card is important - the higher rank wins over lower rank, Ace (A) being high and Two (2) being low. If both players have played a card of equal rank, then the suit determines who wins i.e Hearts (H), Clubs (C), Spades (S) and Diamonds (D). The first player to play all their cards from their hand winks at everyone else at the table, signalling that they are out of cards and points are scored accordingly - 3 points for each player still in the hand minus 1 point for each time the winner winked. When picking up a card, if it makes your hand total 14 or more, then you must "Stumble" - set any 2 cards from your hand down on the table, take another 2 cards fromthe deck and become re-active - your opponent now becomes active. Your original opponent then playes 2 new cards off their 7-card hand with 4 face-up on tht e table so you now see 10 Cards - 5 each side! Play resumes as normal from thereon in (see below). 

The aim of the game is to take tricks by playing higher ranking card than your opponent's highest ranking card played so far in that particular trick OR playing a trump if no other suits remain in your hand). When you take all 5 tricks during one round, this is called "a house". You will only score points if someone else was still IN THE GAME when you won those 5 tricks . .score = number_of_players_left_x3 - 1 Example: 4 Players x 3 Points = 12 Points). Winning all 7 tricks results in an "auto" which is worth 21 pts to whichever player takes it irrespective of how many players are left Garbage dumps can also occur where someone sets down all Joker(s) + any other unmatched garbage they have been holding onto & end that particular trick - worth 26 pts going into End Game provided someone ELSE takes that particular dump ie not yourself!. If you are forced to put down Joker(s) due to holding less than 5 different suits (or no other legal playable card(s)), these act as regular wildcards for that particular trick only - cannot win Automatically on its own however! At end of each round (ie not endgame), whoever has most points..adds this total onto whatever THEY currently have plus any Jokers they may currently hold! Eg at endgame you may have 9pts + 1 Joker = 10pts total! So basically this game keeps going until someone either has 51pts OR all others have 0pts..whichever comes first!.

One variation to this rule whereby person with most current points always goes out next & automatically wins regardless..is ONLY used once somebody reaches 51pts thus ensuring Endgame arrives sooner!. So 52 Card Deck with 4 Players..Eg: Player1 starts with 24pts, Player2 with 14pts, Player3 with 10pts & Player4 with 4pts After Player1 plays 3rd card, next person plays 2nd thence normal Play proceeds until Winner collects ALL 5 Tricks hence 'House'! Now because there are only 3 players left (& assuming Player1 still has highest point total), instead of ending Round at this stage...EndGame immediately commences! So Winner at this stage would be anyone with 34 pts or more! 
Understand? Let's try another example!Player1 starts again with same 24pts but let's say next person now has 17ptsUpon playing 6th & finalcard,,next person MUST put down anything includingJoker( 59 ptstotal!) so long asdoesntputdown anything!! Atthis point,,Player1 would automatically win unless they themselvesputdownJoker(which wouldthenmeanEndGame
