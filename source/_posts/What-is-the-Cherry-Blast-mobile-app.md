#  How do I make a bet on Cherry Blast?

Cherry Blast is a game that can be played on Android and iOS devices. It is a slot machine game with three reels and five paylines. The object of the game is to match symbols on the reels to win prizes.

To make a bet on Cherry Blast, first select your coin denomination. You can choose between $0.01, $0.02, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $1, and $5 per spin. Then, select how many lines you want to play (1-5). Finally, choose how many coins you want to bet per line (1-10). Your total bet will be the coin denomination multiplied by the number of lines multiplied by the number of coins wagered per line.

If you want to spin the reels manually, tap the “Spin” button once you have made your selections. If you would like the game to automatically spin for you, press the “Bet Max” button and it will spin for you using the maximum number of coins possible based on your selections.

If you match three symbols on any payline, you will win a prize. The exact prize depends on which symbols are matched and how much money you wagered per line. For example, if two cherry symbols and one bell symbol line up on a payline while betting 10 coins per line, then you will win 200 coins (2x10x10 = 200). If two cherry symbols and one lemon symbol line up on a payline while betting 5 coins per line, then you will only win 50 coins (2x5x5 = 50).

One thing to keep in mind when betting on Cherry Blast races is that there are often several strong contenders in the field.

There are many other factors to consider when making a Cherry Blast bet, including the age and experience of the horses in the race, as well as their past performances.
