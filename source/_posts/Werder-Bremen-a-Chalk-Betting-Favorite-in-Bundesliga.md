#  Werder Bremen a Chalk Betting Favorite in Bundesliga

Werder Bremen is a chalk betting favorite in the Bundesliga as they return to action this weekend. Werder was a dominant force in the first half of the season, going unbeaten in their opening 10 games. However, they have since dropped off, winning just two matches in their past eight contests.

Despite their recent struggles, Werder is still one of the best sides in the Bundesliga and they’re expected to get back on track with a victory over lowly VfL Wolfsburg this weekend. The home side is currently a 1.50 favorite at most sportsbooks, with Wolfsburg coming in as high as 7.00 underdogs.

The Wolfsburg squad has been one of the biggest disappointments in the Bundesliga this season. They were expected to compete for a top-four spot but instead find themselves just three points above the relegation zone with 11 matches remaining. Wolfsburg has won just two of their last 13 matches and they’re coming off a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Bayern Munich last weekend.

This match presents a great opportunity for Werder to pick up three points at home and move back into third place in the Bundesliga table. They should have no trouble against a Wolfsburg side that is playing terrible football right now and are dealing with some key injuries.

#  Werder Bremen - The Chalk Team of the Bundesliga

The Bundesliga is a professional association football league in Germany and the football league with the highest average stadium attendance worldwide. The Bundesliga was founded in 1963 and consists of 18 teams. The season starts in late summer and runs until late spring, with a winter break of six weeks.

Werder Bremen is one of the 18 teams that compete in the Bundesliga. Werder Bremen was founded in 1899 and has won four German championships and five DFB-Pokals. Werder Bremen plays its home games at Weserstadion, which seats 42,500 spectators.

The 2017-2018 Bundesliga season kicked off on August 18, 2017 and will conclude on May 12, 2018. Werder Bremen is currently in 11th place in the Bundesliga table with 29 points.

The following is a list of Werder Bremen's current players:

#  Werder Bremen - Chalk of the League

Werder Bremen stormed to a 3-0 victory over Hoffenheim on Saturday afternoon, with all three of their goals coming in the first half. The victory saw them move up to sixth in the Bundesliga table, just two points off the Champions League places.

The hosts got off to the perfect start when Kevin Möhwald found the back of the net after just six minutes. They then doubled their lead shortly before halftime as Yuya Osako scored from close range. Nuri Şahin made it 3-0 shortly after the interval, and Werder never looked like letting their opponents back into the game.

The win was a much-needed one for Florian Kohfeldt's side, who had lost their last two matches going into this one. It was also a particularly impressive performance against a Hoffenheim team that had been in good form in recent weeks.

With this result, Werder have now accumulated 25 points from their first 16 Bundesliga games. They will be looking to continue this good form in their upcoming matches against Freiburg, Schalke, and Bayer Leverkusen.

#  Werder Bremen - The Chalkiest Team in the Bundesliga

The Werder Bremen squad can be best described as a bunch of chalk marks. Geared with an aerial assault and led by Max Kruse, the Green-Whites have been one of the most surprising sides in Bundesliga this season.

No player embodies Werder’s aerial game more than Kruse himself. The 29-year-old forward has scored six times in the air so far this season, netting headers in wins over Augsburg, Hoffenheim and Cologne, as well as in draws against Wolfsburg and RB Leipzig.

Kruse is not alone in his aerial prowess, though. Fellow strikers Claudio Pizarro and Johannes Eggestein are both dangerous in the air, while defenders such as Ludwig Augustinsson and Niklas Moisander are also very good at heading the ball.

This commitment to getting the ball into the box has paid off for Werder this season. They have scored more goals from set pieces (12) than any other team in the Bundesliga.

Werder’s success in the air is also due to their superb team work. The players always seem to make space for one another and create chances for each other. This was on full display in their 3-1 win over Hoffenheim last month.

Kruse opened the scoring for Werder with a header, before Pizarro doubled their lead with a powerful strike from close range. Hoffenheim pulled one back through Andrej Kramaric, but Eggestein secured all three points for Werder with a late header.

This victory moved Werder up to fifth place in the Bundesliga table, just four points behind fourth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt. With 14 games left to play, they are still firmly in contention for a place in next year’s UEFA Champions League.

#  Werder Bremen - The Heavy Favorites in the Bundesliga

Werder Bremen, who are coming off a fourth-place finish in the Bundesliga last season, will be looking to improve on that this year and they are unquestionably the heavy favorites to do so. They have a very strong squad with plenty of depth and talent, led by veteran striker Max Kruse and manager Florian Kohfeldt, who did an excellent job in his first season at the helm.

Borussia Dortmund, who finished second last year, will be their closest challengers this season and they too have a very good squad with some dangerous attacking players. However, they may not have enough quality throughout their team to compete with Werder Bremen over the course of a full season.

The other top contenders for the Bundesliga title this year include Bayer Leverkusen, RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich. All three of those teams have their strengths and weaknesses, but overall they are all likely to finish behind Werder Bremen and Dortmund.

This should be another very interesting Bundesliga season, with plenty of close matches and exciting action. Werder Bremen appear to be the team to beat though, and it would come as no surprise if they were crowned champions at the end of the year.
