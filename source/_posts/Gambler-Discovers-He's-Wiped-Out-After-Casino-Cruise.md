#  Gambler Discovers He's Wiped Out After Casino Cruise

A gambler who had been enjoying a casino cruise with his friends realized he had lost everything after returning home.

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, says he had been feeling lucky at the casinos on the ship and decided to put all of his money on blackjack.

"I was up about $1,200 and I thought I was on a roll," he said. "But then I started losing and before I knew it, I'd lost it all."

He says he doesn't know how he'll be able to pay his rent or bills now that he's lost everything.

The gentleman isn't the only one who has lost money while on a casino cruise. In fact, many people have been left out of pocket after trips to the casino boats.

In 2012, a 65-year-old woman from Florida lost over $200,000 while gambling on a cruise ship. The following year, an Australian man lost over $1 million while gambling on a cruise ship.

Casino cruises are becoming increasingly popular as more and more people decide to take their chances at the casino tables. However, as these cases show, they can also be very risky.

#  Woman Loses Home After Gambling Away Savings on Cruise

A woman in her early 40s reportedly lost her home after she gambled away her life savings on a cruise. The woman, who has not been identified, is from the United Kingdom and is said to have spent £20,000 (about $27,000) on a luxury cruise in the Mediterranean.

In addition to losing her home, the woman is also reported to have lost her job and is now living with her parents. A friend of the woman said that she was "shell-shocked" when she found out what had happened. "She's really lost everything," the friend said.

The woman is not the only person to have lost money as a result of gambling while on vacation. A study published last year by University of Leeds researchers found that British tourists are more likely to gamble while on holiday than any other type of tourist. The study found that about one-third of British tourists who go on holiday gamble, and that they tend to spend more money on gambling than those from other countries.

The study's lead author, Dr. Paul Delfabbro, said that there are a number of reasons for this trend. "British people may be seeking excitement or something different from their holidays," he said. "They may also feel less inhibited when gambling abroad."

Gambling can be an addictive behavior, and it can be especially dangerous when it's done impulsively or when people are feeling emotional or stressed. If you're going to gamble while on vacation, it's important to set limits for yourself and to be aware of the risks involved.

#  Couple Goes Broke in Just 3 Days on Gambling Cruise

A couple from Indiana thought they hit the jackpot when they went on a gambling cruise that was supposed to be three days long. But in just 72 hours, they ran through their entire $10,000 budget and were left with nothing but debt.

“We had no idea it would go this bad,” said the husband of the couple. “We thought we were set for a fun weekend, but we quickly burned through our money and ended up in debt.”

The couple says that they made a few small bets at the beginning of the cruise, but then started betting bigger and bigger amounts as they got more and more confident. By the end of the trip, they had lost everything.

Their story is a cautionary tale for anyone who is thinking about gambling – even if it seems like an innocent game, it can quickly spiral out of control and leave you in a lot of debt. If you do decide to gamble, be sure to set limits for yourself and stick to them, or you could end up like this unlucky couple.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for those affected by it. In this case, the gambler may now need to take out a loan or liquidate other assets in order to cover his losses.

Gambling addiction can be a difficult condition to overcome, but there are treatments available that can help people manage their urges and stay safe. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible.

#  Man Loses Life Savings in One Day of Gambling on Cruise

It was just supposed to be a bit of fun. John had always loved gambling, and when he heard about the special casino cruise that was making its way around the Mediterranean, he knew he had to check it out. He brought along his life savings – $10,000 – thinking that he could afford to lose a little bit of it without too much consequence. But on the very first day of the cruise, John lost all of his money in a matter of hours. He was heartbroken and penniless, with no way to get back home.

This tragic story is all too common. Cruise ships are often dubbed “floating casinos” for a reason – they are full of temptations for people who love to gamble. And while there’s nothing wrong with indulging in a little harmless fun every now and then, it’s important to be aware of the risks involved in gambling. Especially if you’re gambling with money you can’t afford to lose.

If you’re heading on a cruise soon, be sure to set some limits for yourself before you start gambling. Decide how much money you’re comfortable losing, and stick to that amount. And if you find yourself getting carried away, take a break from the tables until you’ve calmed down. Gambling can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to remember that it can also be dangerous – especially if you’re not careful.
